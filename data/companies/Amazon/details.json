Amazon offered no evidence that it assesses the human rights impacts of some of its most popular services, and it published less information about how its practices affect users&#x2019; privacy and freedom of expression and information than any other digital platform we evaluate. In 2019 and 2020, investigations by researchers and journalists shed light on the company&#x2019;s failures to protect users from these and other human rights harms.

The language used suggests that Amazon is primarily focused on human rights risks in its supply chain, but not other types of human rights (G1). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Human rights due diligence: </span>Amazon provided no evidence that it conducts any type of human rights impact or risk assessments (G4a-d). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Stakeholder engagement: </span>On its Sustainability Partnerships page, Amazon lists a number of external partners with which it engages, but none of these partnerships address freedom of expression and information, privacy, or potential human rights harms such as discrimination (G5).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Remedy: </span>We found no evidence of a remedy mechanism for freedom of expression and information or privacy related grievances (G6a).

It was the least transparent about platform rules and enforcement. </p><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Content moderation: </span>Content and account rules for Amazon.com and Amazon Drive were easy to find and understand, but Alexa&#x2019;s rules were less accessible. The company failed to provide any proof that it enforces these rules (F4a, F4b). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Algorithmic use and content curation: </span>Amazon did not publish a policy outlining how it uses algorithms on its services (F1d), or about if and how it uses algorithms to curate the content that users can access on either Amazon.com or Alexa (F12). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Advertising content and targeting: </span>Ad content policies and targeting rules were easy to find for Amazon.com. Ad content rules for Alexa were only accessible through Amazon&#x2019;s developer page, and were therefore harder to find (F1b,c). The company published no data about the enforcement of its ad content or targeting policies (F4c).</li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Censorship demands:</span> Amazon was one of two digital platforms&#x2014;along with Samsung&#x2014;that failed to reveal any information about its processes for responding to government and private demands for content and account restrictions (F5a, F5b). Nor did it disclose data on the nature and volume of such requests it received and complied with (F6, F7). </li>\n</ul>","privacy":"<p>Amazon earned the second-lowest privacy score among digital platforms, outperforming only Samsung.

Out of 14 digital platforms, however, Amazon was the least transparent about how it handles user information (P3-P9). It shared nothing about its data retention policies (P6) and did not allow users to obtain a copy of their user information (P8). Amazon offered very limited options for users to exercise control over their own data. In the Amazon Advertising Preferences, users can opt out of interest-based ads, suggesting that targeted advertising is the default. Even after selecting that option, though, users may still see personalized ads, according to the policy (P7). </li>\n</ul><ul>\n  <li><span class=\"font-bold\">Government and private demands for user data: </span>Amazon revealed some information about how it handles government demands for user data. In its Information Requests Transparency Report, Amazon disclosed how it responds to National Security Letter requests, but it did not provide any information about how or whether it responds to other types of non-judicial requests, such as emergency requests from law enforcement. Like other U.S. companies, Amazon did not divulge the exact number of requests received for user data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or National Security Letters, or the actions it took in response to these requests, since it is prohibited by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1613651742129000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mSjltoAD3S7z_61BxrF57\">law</a> from doing so (P11a).

Amazon was one of the least transparent digital platforms about its encryption policies (P16). </li>\n</ul>"}
