{"id":"G1","indicator":"G01","category":"governance","label":"Policy Commitment","description":"The company should publish a formal policy commitment to respect users' human rights to freedom of expression and information and privacy.","guidance":"This indicator seeks evidence that the company has made explicit policy commitments to freedom of expression and information, and to privacy. These standards are outlined in the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights' Operational Principle 16, which states that companies should adopt formal policies publicly affirming their commitments to international human rights principles and standards. Companies should also publish a formal commitment to uphold human rights as they develop and deploy algorithmic decision making systems, in line with Council of Europe recommendations, in its Recommendation on the human rights impacts of algorithmic systems (2020). The company should clearly disclose these commitments in formal policy documents or other communications that reflect official company policy.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false,"companies":["Alibaba","Amazon","AmericaMovil","Apple","ATT","Axiata","Baidu","BhartiAirtel","DeutscheTelekom","Etisalat","Facebook","Google","Kakao","MailRu","Microsoft","MTN","Ooredoo","Orange","Samsung","Telefonica","Telenor","Tencent","Twitter","VerizonMedia","Vodafone","Yandex"],"services":{"Yandex":["Yandex
