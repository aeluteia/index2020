{"id":"P11a","indicator":"P11a","category":"privacy","label":"Data about government demands for user information","description":"The company should regularly publish data about government demands for user information.","guidance":"Companies frequently receive demands from governments to hand over user information. These demands can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign). We expect companies to regularly publish data about the number and type of such demands they receive, and the number of such demands with which they comply. Companies should disclose data about requests they receive by country, including from their home and foreign governments, as well as from law enforcement and courts. We also expect company disclosure to indicate the number of accounts affected by these demands and to delineate by category the demands with which the company has complied. We recognize that companies are sometimes not legally allowed to disclose demands for user information made by governments. However, in these cases, we expect companies to report what types of government demands they are not allowed to disclose by law. Companies should also report this data once a year and should ensure the data can be exported as a structured data file. In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator. For example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws sometimes prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company will lose points if it fails to meet all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users' rights to freedom of expression and privacy.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true,"companies":["Alibaba","Amazon","AmericaMovil","Apple","ATT","Axiata","Baidu","BhartiAirtel","DeutscheTelekom","Etisalat","Facebook","Google","Kakao","MailRu","Microsoft","MTN","Ooredoo","Orange","Samsung","Telefonica","Telenor","Tencent","Twitter","VerizonMedia","Vodafone","Yandex"],"services":{"Yandex":["Yandex
