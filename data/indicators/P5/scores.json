In addition, many companies own or operate a variety of products and services, and we expect companies to clearly disclose how user information can be shared or combined across services. Companies should also publicly commit to the principle of use limitation—meaning they publicly state in their policies that they only use data for purposes for which it was specified—in line with OECD privacy guidelines, the GDPR, and other frameworks, both for the user information they collect and infer.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false,"companies":["Alibaba","Amazon","AmericaMovil","Apple","ATT","Axiata","Baidu","BhartiAirtel","DeutscheTelekom","Etisalat","Facebook","Google","Kakao","MailRu","Microsoft","MTN","Ooredoo","Orange","Samsung","Telefonica","Telenor","Tencent","Twitter","VerizonMedia","Vodafone","Yandex"],"services":{"Yandex":["Yandex
