{"id":"P10b","indicator":"P10b","category":"privacy","label":"Process for responding to private requests for user information","description":"The company should clearly disclose its process for responding to requests for user information that come through private processes.","guidance":"Companies increasingly receive private requests to turn over user information. Such requests are often informal requests for user information from a non-governmental entity that do not involve or come through any formal legal process. According to the Wikimedia Foundation—which publishes transparency reports with e data on the number of these types of such requests it receives—private requests for user information include cases in which another company sends them a letter or an email requesting “non-public information” about one of its users. This could include a user's IP or email address. This indicator expects companies to disclose their processes for handling these types of requests. Companies should explain reasons for complying with these types of requests, and commit to push back on overly broad demands.","isParent":false,"hasParent":true,"companies":["Alibaba","Amazon","AmericaMovil","Apple","ATT","Axiata","Baidu","BhartiAirtel","DeutscheTelekom","Etisalat","Facebook","Google","Kakao","MailRu","Microsoft","MTN","Ooredoo","Orange","Samsung","Telefonica","Telenor","Tencent","Twitter","VerizonMedia","Vodafone","Yandex"],"services":{"Yandex":["Yandex
