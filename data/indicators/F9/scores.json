{"id":"F9","indicator":"F09","category":"freedom","label":"Network management (telecommunications companies)","description":"The company should clearly disclose that it does not prioritize, block, or delay certain types of traffic, applications, protocols, or content for any reason beyond assuring quality of service and reliability of the network.","guidance":"This indicator evaluates whether telecommunications companies clearly disclose if they engage in practices that affect the flow of content through their networks, such as throttling or traffic shaping. We expect these companies to publicly commit to avoid prioritization or degradation of content. In some cases, a company may engage in legitimate traffic shaping practices in order to ensure the flow of traffic through their networks. We expect the company to publicly disclose this and to explain their purpose for doing so. Companies may engage in paid prioritization or zero rating practices, which would not fall under legitimate network management practices. A company may have a statement on its website committing to net neutrality, for example, but also offer zero rating.","isParent":false,"hasParent":false,"companies":["Alibaba","Amazon","AmericaMovil","Apple","ATT","Axiata","Baidu","BhartiAirtel","DeutscheTelekom","Etisalat","Facebook","Google","Kakao","MailRu","Microsoft","MTN","Ooredoo","Orange","Samsung","Telefonica","Telenor","Tencent","Twitter","VerizonMedia","Vodafone","Yandex"],"services":{"Yandex":["Yandex
