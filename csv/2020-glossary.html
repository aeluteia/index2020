          A collection of data associated with a particular
          <strong>user</strong> of a given computer system, service, or
          platform. At a minimum, the user account comprises a user name and
          password, which are used to authenticate the user’s access to his/her
          data.

        <p>
          Data that is in no way connected to another piece of information that
          could enable a user to be identified. The expansive nature of this
          definition used by the Ranking Digital Rights project is necessary to
          reflect several facts. First, skilled analysts can de-anonymize large
          data sets. This renders nearly all promises of anonymization
          unattainable. In essence, any data tied to an “anonymous identifier”
          is not anonymous; rather, this is often pseudonymous data which may be
          tied back to the user’s offline identity. Second, metadata may be as
          or more revealing of a user’s associations and interests than content
          data, thus this data is of vital interest. Third, entities that have
          access to many sources of data, such as data brokers and governments,
          may be able to pair two or more data sources to reveal information
          about users. Thus, sophisticated actors can use data that seems
          anonymous to construct a larger picture of a user.

          responsibility of board members in overseeing company practices on
          these issues should be clearly articulated and disclosed on the
          company’s website.

          situations, including when users upload content for public sharing,
          submit phone numbers for account verification, transmit personal
          information in private conversation with one another, etc. A company
          may also collect this information indirectly, for example, by
          recording log data, account information, metadata, and other related
          information that describes users and/or documents their activities.

        <p>
          According to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), “The
          principle of ‘data minimization’ means that a data controller [“the
          institution or body that determines the purposes and means of the
          processing of personal data”] should limit the collection of personal
          information to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a
          specified purpose. They should also retain the data only for as long
          as is necessary to fulfil that purpose. In other words, data
          controllers should collect only the personal data they really need,
          and should keep it only for as long as they need it.” Source: European

          Also known by the acronym “DNT,” this refers to a setting in a user’s
          browser preferences that tell companies or third parties not to
          “track” them. In other words, every time a user loads a website, any
          parties that are involved in delivering the page (of which there are
          often many, primarily advertisers) are told not to collect or store
          any information about the user’s visit to the page. However, this is
          merely a polite request: a company may ignore a DNT request, and many
          do.

        <div class="entry-tag">Encryption</div>
        <p>
          This essentially hides the content of communications so only the
          intended recipient can view it. The process uses an algorithm to
          convert the message (plaintext) into a coded format (ciphertext) so
          that the message looks like a random series of characters to anyone
          who looks at it. Only someone who has the appropriate encryption key
          can decrypt the message, reversing the ciphertext back into plaintext.
          Data can be encrypted when it is stored and when it is in
          transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, users can encrypt the data on their hard drive so that
          only the intended recipient with the encryption key can decipher the
          contents of the drive. Additionally, users can send an encrypted email
          message, which would prevent anyone from seeing the email contents
          while the message is moving through the network to reach the intended
          recipient. With encryption in transit (for example visible when a
          website uses HTTPS), the communication between a user and a website is
          encrypted, so that outsiders, such as the user’s Internet Service
          Provider can only see the initial visit to the website, but not what
          the user communicates on that website, or the sub-pages that the user
          visits. For more information, see this resource:

        <p>
          An encryption method notably used in HTTPS web traffic and in
          messaging apps, in which a new key pair is generated for each session
          (HTTPS), or for each message exchanged between the parties (messaging
          apps). This way, if an adversary obtains one decryption key, it will
          not be able to decrypt past or future transmissions or messages in the

          model derives from more than one type of source (corporations,
          governments, foundations, public donations, etc.). Its independence,
          rigor, and professionalism are of a high standard, with strong
          participation by human rights organizations that themselves have solid
          track records of independence from corporate and/or government

          Data about an instance of communication or about a user. Companies may
          use different terms to refer to this data, including metadata, basic
          subscriber information, non-content transactional data, account data,

        <p>
          In the U.S., the Stored Communications Act defines non-content
          customer communications or records as, “name; address; local and long
          distance telephone connection records, or records of session times and
          durations; length of service (including start date) and types of
          service utilized; telephone or instrument number or other subscriber
          number or identity (including any temporarily assigned network
          address); and means and source of payment for such service (including
          any credit card or bank account number).” The European Union’s
          Handbook on European Data Protection Law states, “Confidentiality of
          electronic communications pertains not only to the content of a
          communication but also to traffic data, such as information about who
          communicated with whom, when and for how long, and location data, such
          as from where data were communicated.”

          The company provides the user with a direct and easy-to-understand
          mechanism to opt-in or opt-out of data collection, use, or sharing.
          “Opt-in” means the company does not collect, use, or share data for a
          given purpose until users explicitly signal that they want this to
          happen. “Opt-out” means the company uses the data for a specified
          purpose by default, but will cease doing so once the user tells the
          company to stop. Note that this definition is potentially
          controversial as many privacy advocates believe only “opt-in”
          constitutes acceptable control. However, for the purposes of RDR, we
          have elected to count “opt-out” as a form of control.

          Surveillance of a conversation or other electronic communication in

          law enforcement authority to access future communications, while a
          request for stored data gives law enforcement access to records of
          communications that occurred in the past. The U.S. government can gain
          real-time communications access through the Wiretap Act and Pen

        <p>
          A company may collect data and then delete it. If the company does not
          delete it, the data is “retained.” The time between collection and
          deletion is the ‘retention period’. Such data may fall under our
          definition of ‘user information’, or it may be anonymous. Keep in mind
          that truly anonymous data may in no way be connected to a user, the
          user’s identity, behavior or preference, which is very rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          A related topic is the ‘retention period’. For example, a company may
          collect log data on a continual basis, but purge (delete) the data
          once a week. In this case, the data retention period is one week.
          However, if no retention period is specified, the default assumption
          must be that the data is never deleted, and the retention period is
          therefore infinite. In many cases users may wish for their data to be
          retained while they are actively using the service, but would like it
          to be deleted (and therefore not retained) if and when they quit using
          the service. For example, users may want a social network service to
          keep all of their private messages, but when the user leaves the
          network they may wish that all of their private messages be deleted.

          assurance. A vulnerability is the intersection of three elements: a
          system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and
          attacker capability to exploit the flaw.

          A blunt form of traffic shaping in which a network operator slows the

          Adjusting the flow of traffic through a network. This can involve
          conditionally slowing certain types of traffic. Traffic shaping can be
          used for network management purposes (e.g., prioritizing VoIP traffic
          ahead of normal web traffic to facilitate real-time communication) or
          for reasons that counter net neutrality principles (e.g.,
          intentionally slowing video traffic to dissuade users from using
          high-bandwidth applications).

          Many companies allow users to “opt-out” of tracking by setting an
          array of company-specific cookies. If a user deletes cookies in order
          to protect privacy, they are then tracked until they re-set the
          “opt-out” cookie. Furthermore, some companies may require a user to
          install a browser add-on to prevent tracking. These two common
          scenarios are example of users being forced to use signals which are
          company-specific; and therefore do not count. Rather, a user-generated
          signal comes from the user and is a universal message that the user
          should not be tracked. The primary option for user-generated signal
          today is the “Do Not Track” header (covered above), but this wording
          leaves the door open to future means for users to signal they do not
          want to be tracked.

          Any data that is connected to an identifiable person, or may be

          data-mining techniques. As further explanation, user Information is
          any data that documents a user’s characteristics and/or activities.
          This information may or may not be tied to a specific user account.
          This information includes, but is not limited to, personal
          correspondence, user-generated content, account preferences and
          settings, log and access data, data about a user’s activities or
          preferences collected from third parties either through behavioral
          tracking or purchasing of data, and all forms of metadata. User
          Information is never considered anonymous except when included solely
          as a basis to generate global measures (e.g. number of active monthly
          users). For example, the statement, ‘Our service has 1 million monthly
          active users,’ contains anonymous data, since it does not give enough
          information to know who those 1 million users are.
